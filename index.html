<h1>Privacy Policy – LogicUp</h1>

<p>LogicUp respects your privacy.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>
  LogicUp does not collect, store, or share personal data such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.
  Gameplay progress and statistics are stored locally on your device only.
  We do not operate any user accounts or backend servers.
  However, the app uses a third-party SDK (Meta/Facebook) which may collect device-level technical data for analytics and app performance measurement (see below).
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services (Meta/Facebook SDK)</h2>
<p>
  LogicUp uses the Meta (Facebook) SDK on Android and iOS for basic app analytics (installation, activation, custom events),
  app performance measurement, and anonymous usage insights.
</p>
<p>
  The Meta SDK may collect:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device information (device model, OS version, app version, device identifiers)</li>
  <li>In-app event data (e.g. install, app open, custom events)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  LogicUp does not collect or share personal data such as name, email address, phone number, contact info, or precise location.
</p>
<p>
  Data collected by the Meta SDK is processed under Meta’s Data Policy:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  On iOS, the app may show Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) permission dialog.
  Declining tracking does not affect gameplay.
</p>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>
  LogicUp offers an optional one-time in-app purchase (LogicUp Pro – Lifetime).
  Purchases are handled securely by the platform provider:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google Play Billing on Android</li>
  <li>Apple In-App Purchase (IAP) on iOS</li>
</ul>
<p>
  LogicUp does not receive or store any payment information.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
  LogicUp does not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
  If you believe we may have unintentionally collected data from a child, please contact us immediately.
</p>
